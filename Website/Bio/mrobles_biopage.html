 				<p>The first six years of my life I lived in East Haven, CT and then my family moved to Cheshire, CT where we still reside. When I was younger I did a mix of activities that included dance, cheerleading, soccer and golf. When I got to high school I focused my attention on three sports field hockey, cheerleading and golf. Besides being involved in a variety of activities, I also had a love for art. When I was younger I would learn to draw from books and create simple sketches. As I got older and became more serious about my craft I started to take formal art classes. In the eighth grade I found an art studio in my town, Palette Art Studio, where a husband and wife team taught painting and drawing classes. I took classes at the studio from August to June until I graduated from high school. I also took art classes throughout my high school career and during my senior year I was in AP Studio Art. 
				<br>
 				My love for art not only included drawing and painting, but also the digital aspect. In high school I took electives in graphic design, web design and computer art. I was introduced to the basics of Photoshop and Illustrator. I enjoyed comparing and contrasting the processes between my formal art classes and digital classes. I also found it interesting to learn about the principle and elements of design and applying it to my work. Taking these classes helped me decide on a major in the field of design. I wanted a major where I would be able to utilize my creative abilities. I decided on design and merchandising because it was the perfect combination of business and design. 
				<br>
				When it came time to look at colleges I knew I wanted to stay in the East Coast, so I started to research for school that had strong programs in my major. I did not apply to any schools in Connecticut because none of them had my desired major. I applied to many different schools that included Philadelphia University, University of Delaware, URI, Drexel and LIM. I choose Drexel because I wanted to be in the city, it had a strong well-rounded program and the co-op experience. 
				<br>
				I'm currently in the senior year at Drexel University. During my time at Drexel I have gained many valuable skills. I have developed a strong design aesthetic and enhanced my skills in the Adobe suite. Through my design and merchandising classes I have learned how vast this major is and it covers a variety of jobs such as buying, allocating, sourcing fabrics, visual merchandising, and ecommerce. Also, I have developed a strong business foundation through classes like introduction to marketing, foundation to accounting and principles to microeconomics and macroeconomics. When I graduate I hope to find a job in the east coast. I am interested in ecommerce or digital design and helping a company with the design of their website and how to make it more effective to increase their conversion rate.</p>
