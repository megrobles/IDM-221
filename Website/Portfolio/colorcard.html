	<h1>Color Cards</h1>
		<div class="projectinfo">
		<p>The color cards are a tool used in trend forecasting to show new and upcoming trends and colors. My color cards focus on four different looks that are men's wear, women's wear, children's and active. The color cards are set up as a trifold with each section containing differentent information. The left side has my logo, the trend title, category, season, and a brief description about the look. The middle shows photos that are inspired by the trend and the right side shows the trend colors pulled from the photos. The outside of each card was held together by my logo. The layouts for the cards was created in InDesign and the photos were altered in Photoshop.</p>
