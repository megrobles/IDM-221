	<h1>Mood Boards</h1>
		<div class="projectinfo">
		<p>The two boards with the green background are my tear sheets and color board. When creating these boards I started out by selecting a theme. I focused on business attire with sports wear elements. For the tear sheets I went through fashion magazines to find a spread that would fit my theme. Then for the color board I had to find a mood image that would speak to my theme and edit in Photoshop to incorporate the colors from my tear sheets. Next, I had to buy embroidery thread that would speak to my theme's color scheme. The palette I choose was brights plus black and silver. When it came to putting the board together I had to find an object that went with my theme to wrap my embroidery thread around. I also had to create a title and create mounts for both the title and mood photo</p><br>
		<p>Similar to the tear sheets and color board I had to select a theme when creating my trend and model boards. I choose Egypt as my theme and had to do research to find inspiration photos and runway garments that spoke to my theme. Based on what I saw during my research I had to find fabric swatches and embroidery thread. The goal of the trend board was to create a cohesive image so that all the elements worked together. For the model board I used the fabrics I found for the trend board to create looks. I scanned the fabrics and croquis onto the computer so I was able to draw the garments in Illustrator and apply the fabrics and colors in Photoshop.</p>
