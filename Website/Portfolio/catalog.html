	<h1>Catalog</h1>
		<div class="projectinfo">
		<p>As part of the Design and Merchandising program one of the required courses is Presentation Techniques. One of the projects in this class was to create a catalog. There were many necessary steps and revisions to get to the final product.</p><br>
		<p>To create the catalog I utilized Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. The first decision I had to make was what theme and product I wanted to focus on. I choose to create a catalog that focused on ski and snowboard apparel. Next, I went onto <a href="http://www.moodfabrics.com">Mood Fabrics</a> to search for colors and prints that spoke to my theme and were cohesive. Also, I had to search for garments to include in my catalog. In Photoshop I applied the fabrics onto the clothes that I found in my research. In Illustrator I also created flats for some of the garments that are featured in my catalog.</p><br>
		<p>When it came time to put my catalog together I had to find images and graphics that would speak to my theme. I decided that I wanted each spread to represent a different color. I had to alter the colors of my images and graphics on Photoshop to correspond with the different spreads. I did the layout of my catalog in InDesign, which included putting together all visual and text elements.</p>
