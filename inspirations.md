##vogue.com

Some of the aspects that I like about the website vogue.com is the clean white background. Since the site contains articles on various topics such as fashion, runway, beauty, and culture, having a white background doesn't distract from the content. Also, I like how the top navigation follows the user as the scroll through the website. This makes it easy to select specific topics and search the website without having to go to the top of the page. There is consistency in the layout of the article links on the website. On the left side it shows how long ago the article was posted, the category, and buttons to share and comment. Then there is an image and on the right side is the article name and author. This gives the website a sense of cohesion and it makes it easy for me, the user, to comprehend the information. 


##youtube.com

When I visit YouTube I like how the search box is a major part of the navigation bar. This makes it easy to search the website and find a specific videos. Also, YouTube is great for recommending videos based on my previous searches. This site has a uniform look of how the videos are presented with them all being the same size. The videos are presented in a structured format such as a grid or a column. This layout keeps the website from looking cluttered. Also, the simple background keeps the focus on the content. 


##flipboard.com

I like that Flipboard is customizable to my preferences and I am in control of what topics I want to read. Also, I like that based on that topics I choose the site suggests other topics and magazines that I would want to follow. When I hover over the links to the articles it shows buttons to flip, like and share the article. This feature makes the site intuitive beacause I can save interesting articles so I will be able to find them later. Also, the links to the articles displays the topic of the article, which gives me a clear idea of what I'm going to read before clicking on the link. There are many ways to search for articles from cover stories that show a compilation of many different topics to looking at articles from a specific topic. Also, I think that it interesting how the site places emphasis on certain articles based on their size. Some of the links to the articles take up the entire width of the screen placing more emphasis on these articles.
